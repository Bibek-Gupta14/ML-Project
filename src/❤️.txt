1. components Folder

    This folder contains the actual logic for the individual steps (stages) of your machine learning workflow. Each file represents a specific phase of the lifecycle.

data_ingestion.py

    Role: Responsible for reading data from the source (databases, APIs, or local CSVs).

    Key Tasks: Reads the dataset, performs the train-test split, and saves the raw data (e.g., train.csv, test.csv) into an artifacts folder.

data_transformation.py

Role: Handles data cleaning and feature engineering.

    Key Tasks: Implements preprocessing pipelines (handling missing values, OneHotEncoding, StandardScaler, etc.). It saves the preprocessor object (usually as a preprocessor.pkl file) to be used later on new data.

model_trainer.py

Role: Responsible for training and evaluating the model.

    Key Tasks: Defines the model algorithms (e.g., XGBoost, Linear Regression), performs hyperparameter tuning, trains the model, and saves the final model artifact (e.g., model.pkl).

2. pipeline Folder
In your specific structure, this folder seems to house the infrastructure and utility scripts that support the main components.

exception.py

Role: Custom Error Handling.

Key Tasks: Defines a custom exception class. It ensures that when an error occurs, the system provides detailed information, such as the exact file name and line number where the code crashed, rather than a generic Python error message.

logger.py

Role: Event Logging.

Key Tasks: Sets up the logging configuration. It creates log files to record the execution flow (e.g., "Data Ingestion started", "Model Training completed") and captures errors for debugging purposes.

utils.py

Role: Helper Functions.

Key Tasks: Contains common functions used repeatedly across different components to avoid code duplication. Common examples include:

save_object(): To save pickle files.

load_object(): To load pickle files.

evaluate_models(): A generic function to calculate R2 score or Accuracy for multiple models at once.
